## Intelligence Center

The Intelligence Center is a part of the application that uses SpiderFoot to gather intelligence about email addresses, domains, and IP addresses.
It is also used to gather information about the target's social media accounts, phone numbers, and other relevant information.

### How to use it

To use the Intelligence Center, you need to enter the target's email address or domain name in the search bar.
Once you have entered the target's information, click on the "Search" button to start the intelligence gathering process.

After the intelligence gathering process is complete, you will see a list of the target's information gathered by SpiderFoot. This information includes the target's email addresses, domains, IP addresses, and other relevant information.

You can also use the "Export" button to export the target's information to a CSV file. This file can then be imported into other applications or used for further analysis.
