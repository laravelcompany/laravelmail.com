## Workflows

A **Workflow** is initiated by a **Trigger** and executes a sequence of **Tasks** in a specified order. The package uses a **DataBus** to facilitate the transfer of information between tasks, ensuring smooth data handling and process flow.



## Workflows Logs

The workflow logs are stored in the database and can be accessed via the **WorkflowLogs** button in the bottom bar.

### Triggers

**Triggers** act as the starting points for workflows, determining how and when a workflow is activated.

Each trigger defines the conditions under which a workflow will be executed.

**Note**: Additional trigger types will be introduced in future updates.

#### ObserverTrigger

The Observer Trigger can listen to Eloquent Model Events and will then pass the Model which triggered the Event to the
Workflow.

To make it Work, add the WorkflowObservable to your Eloquent Model.

``` php
 use WorkflowObservable;
```

#### ButtonTrigger

The Button Trigger is able to render a button in your "frontend" and Execute a Workflow based by a click on it.
ButtonTrigger also accept an Model which they pass to the Workflow.

You can influence the buttons by adding your own classes or styles directly to each ButtonTrigger.
Also you can publish the blade and change it according to your needs.

You have multiple ways of rendering ButtonTrigger.

##### ByName
``` php
 {!! LaravelCompany\Mail\Triggers\ButtonTrigger::renderButtonByName('name', $model) !!}
```

##### ByWorkflowId
``` php
 {!! LaravelCompany\Mail\Triggers\ButtonTrigger::renderButtonByWorkflowId(workflow_id, $model) !!}
```

##### ByCategory
This will return all Triggers from the Category.

``` php
 {!! LaravelCompany\Mail\Triggers\ButtonTrigger::renderButtonsByCategory('categoryName', $model) !!}
```
