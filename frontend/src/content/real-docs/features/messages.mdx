## Overview

After a campaign has been dispatched, a message will be generated for each targeted Subscriber. A message represents a single email. You can view all of your messages by clicking the _Messages_ link in the sidebar. You will notice that there are two types of message:

### Drafts

A draft is a message that has been queued using the `Queue Draft` campaign sending behaviour. The _Drafts_ tab offers a listing of every drafted message and allows you to preview the final message before sending. A draft message will only be sent to the subscriber when you click on the _Send Now_ button.

### Sent

Similarly, the _Sent_ tab offers a listing of every message that has been dispatched. You can use this page to track and filter the status of your messages.
