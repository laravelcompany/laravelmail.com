## Installation

Laravel Mail can be installed as a stand-alone application (i.e. including everything you need to run Laravel Mail),
or as a package inside an existing Laravel application.

This page covers the stand-alone installation.
If you want to install Laravel Mail as a package, then head over to the [package installation page](/docs/getting-started/package-installation).

### Requirements

To run Laravel Mail, your environment must meet a few minimum requirements:

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Laravel 11 or higher
- A MySQL or PostgreSQL database


### Installing Laravel Mail

Clone the repository to your environment, using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laravelcompany/app.laravelmail.com.git
```

Next, change into the directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd app.laravelmail.com
composer install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can run the migrations to create the database tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Finally, you can run the application:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You should now be able to access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.
