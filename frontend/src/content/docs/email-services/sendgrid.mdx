## Sending Emails

To send e-mails using the Twilio Sendgrid provider, you will need a Sendgrid account. If you don't already have one, [visit the Sendgrid website](https://sendgrid.com/) and sign up. No credit card is required, and you can get up to 100 free emails per month.

Once registered, open the `Setup Guide`, choose the `Web API` integration and select the PHP language option.


Generate an API key and copy it to your Laravel Mail configuration.


Check the `I've integrated the code above` box and click Next.

Send a test e-mail from Laravel Mail and if it works successfully click _Verify integration_.

## Tracking


Open and click tracking is enabled by default in SendGrid, but if you'd like to check the settings you'll find them under _Settings_ > _Tracking_.


You can also enable subscription tracking from this page. If enabled, SendGrid will automatically add unsubscribe links to the bottom of every e-mail you send.


To enable tracking within Laravel Mail you'll need to enable event notifications from _Settings_ > _Mail Settings_.

The `HTTP POST URL` depends on your domain, but must end with `/api/v1/webhooks/sendgrid`. For example, if Laravel Mail is installed at `https://campaigns.marketing.com`, then each webhook should point to `https://campaigns.marketing.com/api/v1/webhooks/sendgrid`.

That's it! You're now setup to send and track e-mails using SendGrid.
