CelestialDocs creates your site's HTML pages from your content, offering flexible options through Markdown frontmatter. Additionally, CelestialDocs projects have complete access to [Astro's robust page generation tools](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/). This guide explains how page generation works in CelestialDocs.

## Content pages

### File formats

CelestialDocs supports authoring content in Markdown and MDX with no configuration required. 

### Add pages

Add new pages to your site by creating `.md` or `.mdx` files in `src/content/docs/`. Use sub-folders to organize your files and to create multiple path segments.

### Type-safe frontmatter

All CelestialDocs pages share a customizable set of frontmatter properties that control their appearance:

```yaml
---
title: Sample
author: hyperoot
pubDatetime: 2024-04-09T12:00:00-05:30
modDatetime: 2024-08-01T12:00:00-05:30 
description: 'Sample description'
draft: true
tags:
- anything
- you
- want
hide_toc: 
hide_sidenav: 
hide_breadcrumbs: 
---
```

A snippet template is also included with this project if you are using vscode. Just type `docs` in any `.md` or `.mdx` file and you will see a suggestion for a template named `docs`. Most of the frontmatter properties are commented. Uncomment them by removing `#`. For date and time we use [standard date-time string format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#date_time_string_format).
