title: Authoring Content in MDX
---

CelestialDocs supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files, which extend Markdown by allowing the inclusion of React components within your content. This enables dynamic and interactive documentation. We specifically use [GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)](https://mdxjs.com/guides/gfm/). Markdown features, refer to the [Markdown documentation](/guides/authoring-content-in-md).

## Using a component

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag. These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your import statement:

```mdx
---
title: Welcome to my docs
---

import Callout from "@/components/Callout.astro";

<Callout variant="info">
Sample callout
</Callout>
```

See the [components](/guides/components) for all custom components and their available fields. 

## Using GFM (GitHub-Flavored Markdown)

MDX in CelestialDocs supports [GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)](https://mdxjs.com/guides/gfm/), which includes additional features such as tables, task lists, and strikethrough text.

### Task Lists

You can create task lists using GFM syntax.

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

```md
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

### Tables

You can also create tables using GFM.

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

```md
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```
### Strikethrough

Strikethrough text can be created using double tilde `~~`.

This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.

```md
This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.
```

## Frontmatter

MDX files support frontmatter in the same way as Markdown files. You can define metadata at the top of the file.

```mdx
---
title: Sample MDX Page
---

Page content goes here, after `---`.
```

Refer to the frontmatter reference for all available fields and how to add custom fields.

## Using JavaScript Expressions

MDX allows you to use JavaScript expressions within your content. This can be useful for dynamic content and calculations.

Current year: {new Date().getFullYear()}

```mdx
Current year: {new Date().getFullYear()}
```


```mdx
**Fibonacci Sequence**

The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:

{
  Array.from({ length: 10 }).map((_, i) => (
    <span key={i}>{fibonacci(i)} </span>
  ))
}
```

## Syntax Highlighting

MDX supports syntax highlighting for code blocks using backticks. You can specify the language for proper highlighting.

````mdx
```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, MDX!</div>;
};
```
````

MDX combines the best of Markdown and JSX, making it a powerful tool for creating rich, interactive documentation. For more details on Markdown syntax, please see the [Markdown documentation](/guides/authoring-content-in-md).
