title: Sidebar Navigation
---
By default, CelestialDocs sites include sidebar navigation. It is generated after parsing the folder structure of `docs` folder.

## Custom order

By default, it will order the side navigation items (folders and files) alphabetically. But we can provide a custom order to the side navigation items. 

In `config.js` you can set `side_nav_menu_order` with an order of items. Mind that the type is an array of strings. Each string is just the `slug` of that page.

```js
// config.js

export const side_nav_menu_order: string[] = [
  "getting-started",
  "guides",
  "guides/pages",
  "guides/table-of-contents",
  "guides/sidebar-navigation",
  "custom-components",
  "reference",
];
```

You can include `folder-name`, `md` & `mdx` files. If you don't order every items, then the left out folders and files will the ordered after that alphabetically. Don't add extensions for `md` & `mdx` files.

You can find the slug of any page, if you simply run an instance of your project and look for the path after the port number in the url. For instance, the url in my local machine for this exact page is
```
http://localhost:4321/guides/sidebar-navigation
```

The slug will be `guides/sidebar-navigation`. 

## Hide Sidebar Navigation

### Hide globally

In `config.js`, you can hide sidebar navigation by keeping the value of `hide_side_navigations` as `true`. This will hide the sidebar navigation for all pages. 

```js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_side_navigations: true,
  ...
};
```

### Hide locally

To hide sidebar navigation for specific pages only, then add `hide_sidenav` in the frontmatter as `true`.

```yaml
---
hide_sidenav: true
---
```
