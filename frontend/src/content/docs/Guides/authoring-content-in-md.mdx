title: Authoring Content in Markdown
---

CelestialDocs supports the full range of Markdown syntax in `.md` files as well as frontmatter YAML to define metadata such as a tilte and description. 

## Frontmatter

You can modify individual pages in CelestialDocs by setting values in their fromtmatter. Frontmetter is set at the top of your files between `---` separators.

```md
---
title: Sample
---

Page content goes here, after `---`.
```

Every page must include at least a `title`. See the [frontmatter reference](/reference/frontmatter-ref) for all available fields and how to add custom fields. 

## Inline styles

Text can be **bold**, _italic_ or ~~strikethrough~~.

```md
Text can be **bold**, _italic_ or ~~strikethrough~~.
```

You can [link to another page](/getting-started).

```md
You can [link to another page](/getting-started).
```

You can highlight `inline code` with backticks. 

```md
You can highlight `inline code` with backticks. 
```

## Images

Images in CelestialDocs use [Astro's built-in optimized asset support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/).

Markdown and MDX support the Markdown syntax for displaying images that includes alt-text for screen readers and assistive technology.

```md

```

Relative image paths are also supported for images stored locally in your project.



## Headings

You can structure content using a heading. Headings in Markdown are indicated by a number of # at the start of the line.

### How to structure page content in CelestialDocs

CelestialDocs is configured to automatically use your page title as a top-level heading and will include an “Overview” heading at top of each page's table of contents. We recommend starting each page with regular paragraph text content and using on-page headings from `<h2>` and down:

```md
---

### Automatic heading anchor links

Using headings in Markdown will automatically give you anchor links so you can link directly to certain sections of your page:

```
---
title: My page of content
description: How to use CelestialDocs's built-in anchor links
---

## Introduction

I can link to [my conclusion](#conclusion) lower on the same page.

## Conclusion

`https://my-site.com/page1/#introduction` navigates directly to my Introduction.
```

Level 2 (`<h2>`) and Level 3 (`<h3>`) headings will automatically appear in the page table of contents.

Learn more about how Astro processes heading ids in the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#heading-ids).

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.
>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.

```md
> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.
>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.
```

## Code blocks

A code block is indicated by a block with three backticks ``` at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```


````text
```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```
````

## Details

Details (also known as “disclosures” or “accordions”) are useful to hide content that is not immediately relevant. Users can click a short summary to expand and view the full content.

Use the standard HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements in your Markdown content to create a disclosure widget.

You can nest any other Markdown syntax inside a `<details>` element.

<details>
<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>

The [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `-40°`.

</details>
