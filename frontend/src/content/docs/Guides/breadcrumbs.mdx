In `config.js`, you can disable the search function by keeping the value of `hide_breadcrumbs` as `true`.

```js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_breadcrumbs: true
  ...
};
```

### Hide locally

To hide ToC for specific pages only, then add `hide_breadcrumbs` in the frontmatter as `true`.
