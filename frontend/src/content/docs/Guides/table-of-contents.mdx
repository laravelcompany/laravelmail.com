## Hide Table of Contents

### Hide globally

In `config.js`, you can hide table of contents by keeping the value of `hide_table_of_contents` as `true`. This will hide the ToC for all pages. 

```js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_table_of_contents: true,
  ...
};
```

### Hide locally

To hide ToC for specific pages only, then add `hide_toc` in the frontmatter as `true`.

```yaml
---
hide_toc: true
---
```
