## Overview

Tags offer a convenient means of grouping subscribers together. For example, you may have one tag for your monthly newsletter and another for customers that want to be notified of a new product launch.

Tags are completely optional; a subscriber can be assigned one tag, multiple tags, or none at all.

## View Tags

To view a listing of your tags, click the _Tags_ button on the subscribers index page. This will take you to the tags index.

## Adding and Updating Tags

Tags can be added in the following ways:

- through the application interface
- via the API

### Application Interface

To add a new tag through the application interface, navigate to the tags index page and click _New Tag_.

To edit a tag, click the _Edit_ button on the tag listing.

Tags are very simple and only require a `Name`, which must be unique across all tags in the current workspace.
