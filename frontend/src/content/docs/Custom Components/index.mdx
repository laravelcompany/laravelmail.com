Components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently. Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed. CelestialDocs supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

## Callout

The `Callout` component is designed to highlight important information, warnings, errors, or successes in your application. It is a versatile alert box with customizable variants and titles.

<Callout>
  See the [Callout](/custom-components/callout) for all custom props and their usages. 
</Callout>

## Card

You can display content in a box matching CelestialDocs' styles using the `<Card>` component.

<Card title="Card with Custom Icon and Color" icon={Cat} color="Red">
  This is a card with a custom icon and color.
</Card>
