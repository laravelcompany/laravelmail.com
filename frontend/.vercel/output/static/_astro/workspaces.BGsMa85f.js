## Overview

Workspaces allow you to maintain separate subscriber lists and campaigns for your projects.
 You may, for instance, have one workspace for your personal site's mailing list and another for your podcast.

## View Workspaces

Click the username displayed on the top-right side of the page, and select the _Workspaces_ item from the drop-down menu. This will display a listing of your existing workspaces and a form which allows you to create new ones.

## Add Workspace

A workspace only requires a name. Your user account will automatically be added to the new workspace with the administrator role.

## Switch Workspace

If you have multiple workspaces, you will notice a select box next to your username on the top-right hand side of the page. The default selected option is your current Workspace. You can easily switch to your other workspaces by clicking the select box and choosing your desired workspace from the list that is shown.

## Managing Workspace Members

> You must be the owner of the workspace to do this.

To manage the members of your workspace, click the _Manage Users_ menu item.

You will see a list of all the users currently in your active workspace.

### Inviting Members
To add a new member, you must enter their email address in the field under the Invite User section, and then click _Send Invite._

Users who have not yet accepted the invite will be shown in a separate Invited Users section.

To retract the invitation, click the _Retract_ button next to the user's name.

### Removing Members
To remove a user who is already in the workspace, click the _Remove_ button next to their name in the list.`,a={title:"Workspaces",author:"Laravel Mail",draft:!1,tags:[],hide_breadcrumbs:!1,hide_toc:!1,hide_sidenav:!1,max_width:!1},s={type:"content",filePath:"/home/saturn/Projects/laravel.apps/laravelmail.com/frontend/src/content/docs/workspaces.mdx",rawData:void 0};export{s as _internal,n as body,t as collection,a as data,e as id,o as slug};
