# Installation


This page covers the stand-alone installation. If you want to install Laravel Mail as a package, then head over to the [Package Installation guide](/docs/package-installation).


## Requirements

To run Laravel Mail, your environment must meet a few minimum requirements:

- PHP ≥ 8.3
- Git
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- MySQL (≥ 5.7), PostgreSQL (≥ 9.4), Sqlite (≥ 3.33)

## Installing Laravel Mail

### Install Dependencies

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and run \`composer install\` to install Laravel Mail and its dependencies.

From here, you can move on to the [Configuration & Setup](/docs//configuration) step.

### Webserver

You will need to use a webserver (for example, Apache or nginx), in order to host your Laravel Mail installation.

When setting up your webserver, it should be pointed to the \`public\` directory in order to correctly serve Laravel Mail.

For example, in nginx:

\`\`\`
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name campaigns.example.com;
    root /var/www/campaigns.example.com/public;
}
\`\`\`
