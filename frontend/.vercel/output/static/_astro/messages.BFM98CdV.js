## Overview

After a campaign has been dispatched, a message will be generated for each targeted Subscriber. A message represents a single email. You can view all of your messages by clicking the _Messages_ link in the sidebar. You will notice that there are two types of message:

### Drafts

A draft is a message that has been queued using the \`Queue Draft\` campaign sending behaviour. The _Drafts_ tab offers a listing of every drafted message and allows you to preview the final message before sending. A draft message will only be sent to the subscriber when you click on the _Send Now_ button.

### Sent

Similarly, the _Sent_ tab offers a listing of every message that has been dispatched. You can use this page to track and filter the status of your messages.`,n={title:"Messages",author:"Laravel Mail",draft:!1,tags:[],hide_breadcrumbs:!1,hide_toc:!1,hide_sidenav:!1,max_width:!1},i={type:"content",filePath:"/home/saturn/Projects/laravel.apps/laravelmail.com/frontend/src/content/docs/messages.mdx",rawData:void 0};export{i as _internal,t as body,s as collection,n as data,e as id,a as slug};
